## **JPEG-based image coding solution for data storage on DNA ~ Prototype**

I came across this project on DNA based storage, I thought it would be the ideal for long term
storage needs. Today's harddisks have a storage life of no longer than 10-20 years.And recent
studies have shown that DNA is a promising future for long term storage devices. I would like to
look into making a simulator and looking into the efficiency of JPEG based DNA storage of
Data. The project would involve applying conventional JPEG algorithms combined with DNA
compression algorithms to achieve an efficient model

Used a simplified version of DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform)

Moving on to using forms of DNA Sequence Compression. Wish me luck. Fingers crossed to find something beautiful <3. 

Refer to Project Proposal File for Simplified Idea.
